Here’s an example of a more complex medical discharge summary with at least three ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Elizabeth Thompson  
**Date of Admission:** 03/21/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 03/28/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection complicated by acute kidney injury and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- A41.9: Sepsis, unspecified organism  
- N39.0: Urinary tract infection, site not specified  
- N17.9: Acute kidney failure, unspecified  
- E11.9: Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, dysuria, and decreased urine output. Initial evaluation revealed leukocytosis, elevated serum creatinine, and positive urine cultures confirming a urinary tract infection. Blood cultures were also positive for Escherichia coli. The patient developed sepsis with hypotension and tachycardia, requiring fluid resuscitation and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

During hospitalization, the patient’s condition was further complicated by acute kidney injury, likely due to sepsis and dehydration. Nephrology was consulted, and the patient was managed with careful fluid balance and monitoring of renal function. Blood glucose levels were also consistently elevated, requiring adjustments to the patient’s diabetes management regimen. Over the course of the week, the patient showed gradual clinical improvement, with normalization of vital signs and improved renal function.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days (for UTI).  
- Metformin, 500 mg once daily with meals (for diabetes).  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain or fever.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with their primary care physician and nephrologist within two weeks. Bloodwork, including serum creatinine and HbA1c, should be repeated prior to follow-up. Return to the emergency department if symptoms such as fever, decreased urine output, or altered mental status recur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on the importance of hydration and maintaining blood glucose control to prevent future complications. A referral to a diabetes educator was provided for further education.
