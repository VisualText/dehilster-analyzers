Certainly! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Emily Davis  
**Birthdate:** 12/26/1952 
**Date of Admission:** 03/27/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/04/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Status epilepticus, secondary traumatic brain injury, and aspiration pneumonia.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- G41.9: Status epilepticus, unspecified  
- S06.9X9A: Traumatic brain injury, unspecified, initial encounter  
- J69.0: Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food and vomit (aspiration pneumonia)  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient was brought to the emergency department in status epilepticus following a head injury sustained during a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She required emergent intubation for airway protection and seizure control with IV lorazepam and continuous midazolam infusion. A CT scan of the head revealed no acute intracranial hemorrhage but findings consistent with traumatic brain injury. She later developed fever and hypoxia, and chest X-ray confirmed aspiration pneumonia.

Management included antibiotics (IV piperacillin-tazobactam) for aspiration pneumonia, antiepileptic medication adjustment to include levetiracetam and valproic acid, and supportive care in the intensive care unit. Over the course of hospitalization, the patientâ€™s condition gradually improved, with resolution of pneumonia and stabilization of seizure activity. By day 8, the patient was extubated and transferred to the medical ward for further rehabilitation and monitoring.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levetiracetam, 500 mg twice daily.  
- Valproic acid, 250 mg twice daily.  
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate, 875 mg twice daily for 5 days.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for headache or pain.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a neurologist within one week for seizure management and with a primary care physician to monitor recovery from pneumonia. A referral to physical therapy was provided to address residual motor and cognitive deficits from the traumatic brain injury. Immediate medical attention should be sought if she experiences recurrent seizures, worsening neurological symptoms, or respiratory distress.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on adherence to antiepileptic medications to prevent seizure recurrence. Safety measures, such as avoiding activities with a high risk of falls and ensuring supervision during bathing, were emphasized. She and her family were provided with resources for seizure first aid training.
