Certainly! Here's a new detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Mark Reynolds  
**Birthdate:** 06/05/1948 
**Date of Admission:** 04/05/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/14/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Severe acute ischemic colitis, secondary sepsis, and electrolyte imbalance.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- K55.0: Acute vascular disorders of intestine  
- A41.9: Sepsis, unspecified organism  
- E87.6: Hypokalemia  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and signs of dehydration. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed ischemic changes in the descending colon. Bloodwork showed elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and potassium depletion, alongside positive blood cultures confirming sepsis. Immediate fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics (IV piperacillin-tazobactam) were initiated. 

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed necrosis in a segment of the descending colon requiring partial colectomy. Postoperatively, electrolyte imbalances were corrected with IV potassium supplementation, and the sepsis was managed with continued antibiotic therapy and close hemodynamic monitoring. Over the hospital stay, the patient's condition stabilized, and bowel function gradually returned. By discharge, he was tolerating a soft diet and ambulating independently.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days.  
- Potassium chloride, 20 mEq twice daily for 3 days.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with his surgeon within one week for wound evaluation and further management of bowel recovery. A primary care physician and gastroenterologist follow-up are recommended to monitor electrolyte levels and assess long-term gastrointestinal health. Bloodwork, including potassium and lactate levels, should be repeated prior to follow-up visits. Immediate medical attention should be sought if symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, or altered bowel habits recur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was educated on dietary changes, including a low-residue diet to minimize bowel strain during recovery. Information on sepsis signs and preventive measures was provided. Support resources for coping with dietary adjustments and surgical recovery were shared with the patient and family.
