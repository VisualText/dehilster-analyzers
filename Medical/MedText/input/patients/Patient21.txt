Certainly! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Jason Carter  
**Birthdate:** 01/05/1962 
**Date of Admission:** 03/30/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/08/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Infectious meningitis complicated by septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- G03.9: Meningitis, unspecified  
- A41.9: Sepsis, unspecified organism  
- D65: Disseminated intravascular coagulation  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status, and a petechial rash. Lumbar puncture revealed cerebrospinal fluid findings consistent with bacterial meningitis. Blood cultures confirmed *Neisseria meningitidis*, and sepsis with multi-organ involvement was diagnosed. The patient rapidly developed hypotension requiring vasopressor support and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with thrombocytopenia and prolonged clotting times.

Management included broad-spectrum antibiotics (IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin) initiated empirically and tailored after culture results, as well as dexamethasone to reduce inflammation. The patient required intensive care, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and blood product transfusion to manage DIC. Neurology and hematology were consulted, and close monitoring of organ function was performed. Over the course of hospitalization, the patientâ€™s condition gradually improved, with resolution of the infectious process and stabilization of coagulopathy.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Ceftriaxone, 2 g IV every 24 hours to complete a 10-day course.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for fever or headache.  
- Multivitamins to support recovery.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with infectious disease and hematology specialists within one week for continued management and evaluation of residual coagulopathy. Repeat lumbar puncture and coagulation studies are recommended prior to follow-up appointments. Immediate medical attention should be sought if symptoms such as fever, headache, or neurological changes recur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient and family were counseled on recognizing signs of meningitis recurrence and the importance of completing the antibiotic course. Education on meningococcal vaccination was provided to prevent future
