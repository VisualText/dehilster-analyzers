Certainly! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Laura Green  
**Birthdate:** 10/11/1947 
**Date of Admission:** 03/29/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/07/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Complicated diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and hypertension.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- E10.10: Type 1 diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis without coma  
- N17.9: Acute kidney failure, unspecified  
- I10: Essential (primary) hypertension  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and altered sensorium. Initial labs revealed elevated blood glucose levels, an anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels. Hypertension was also noted on admission. The patient was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely precipitated by poor glycemic control and dehydration. 

Management included intravenous insulin infusion, aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction (including potassium supplementation), and antihypertensive adjustments. Endocrinology and nephrology were consulted to optimize diabetes and kidney function management. Gradual improvement in blood glucose levels and acid-base balance was achieved. Renal function also improved with fluid therapy, and by discharge, the patientâ€™s symptoms had resolved, and lab values had normalized.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Insulin glargine, 20 units once daily.  
- Insulin lispro, sliding scale for mealtime doses.  
- Lisinopril, 10 mg daily for hypertension.  
- Potassium chloride, 20 mEq twice daily for ongoing supplementation.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with an endocrinologist and nephrologist within one week to monitor renal function and glycemic control. Additional lab work, including HbA1c and renal panel, should be completed prior to follow-up visits. Immediate care should be sought if symptoms such as severe fatigue, confusion, or recurrent vomiting occur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was provided with education on DKA prevention, including recognizing early signs of ketoacidosis and adhering to insulin regimens. Nutrition counseling emphasized a balanced diabetic diet and adequate hydration. Resources for diabetes self-management and support groups were offered.
