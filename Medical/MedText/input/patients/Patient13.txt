Of course! Here’s another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

**Patient Name:** Angela Carter 
**Birthdate:** 03/13/1955
**Date of Admission:** 03/20/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 03/29/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Complicated diverticulitis with peritonitis and anemia of chronic disease.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- K57.20: Diverticulitis of large intestine without perforation or abscess  
- K65.1: Peritonitis (generalized)  
- D63.8: Anemia in chronic diseases classified elsewhere  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. CT scan revealed diverticulitis with localized perforation and peritonitis. Initial management included bowel rest, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam), and fluid resuscitation. Due to worsening symptoms, surgical intervention was required. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a Hartmann’s procedure was carried out, including sigmoid colon resection and temporary colostomy placement. 

During hospitalization, anemia was identified with low hemoglobin levels and iron studies indicative of anemia secondary to chronic disease. The patient was managed with IV iron supplementation and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels. Postoperatively, the patient’s condition steadily improved, with resolution of fever and normalization of vital signs by day 7.  

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Oral ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days.  
- Oral metronidazole, 500 mg three times daily for 7 days.  
- Ferrous sulfate, 325 mg once daily.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a colorectal surgeon within two weeks to discuss colostomy care and reversal options. Hemoglobin levels should be monitored through follow-up bloodwork at the primary care physician's office. Signs of infection, such as fever, redness at the incision site, or increased abdominal pain, should prompt immediate medical attention.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was educated on colostomy care and provided with resources for ostomy support groups. Dietary changes, including a low-residue diet, were recommended to avoid bowel irritation during recovery.
