**Patient Name:** Alice Nguyen  
**Birthdate:** 08/16/1967  
**Date of Admission:** 04/06/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/16/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flare with lupus nephritis, pericarditis, and secondary anemia.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- M32.14: Systemic lupus erythematosus with organ or system involvement (lupus nephritis)  
- I31.9: Pericarditis, unspecified  
- D63.8: Anemia in chronic diseases classified elsewhere  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with fatigue, joint pain, swelling, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. Laboratory findings included elevated creatinine, proteinuria, and low hemoglobin levels. Echocardiography confirmed pericardial effusion secondary to pericarditis. A renal biopsy revealed lupus nephritis (class IV).

Management included high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for three days, followed by oral prednisone taper, and initiation of mycophenolate mofetil for lupus nephritis. Pericarditis was treated with colchicine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient required erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplementation for anemia. Over the hospital stay, her symptoms improved, renal function stabilized, and inflammation resolved.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Prednisone, 20 mg daily, with gradual taper over six weeks.  
- Mycophenolate mofetil, 500 mg twice daily.  
- Colchicine, 0.6 mg once daily.  
- Ferrous sulfate, 325 mg once daily.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with her rheumatologist and nephrologist within one week. Repeat bloodwork, including renal panel and inflammatory markers, is recommended before the appointments. She should seek immediate medical attention if she experiences worsening chest pain, swelling, or severe fatigue.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on adhering to her medication regimen and recognizing early signs of lupus flare-ups, such as fever, joint pain, or rash. Dietary modifications, including low-sodium and kidney-friendly guidelines, were discussed. She was also provided with information on lupus support groups and educational resources for disease management.
