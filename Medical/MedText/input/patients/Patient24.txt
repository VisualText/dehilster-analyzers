Certainly! Here's yet another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Rachel Thompson  
**Birthdate:** 11/15/1976 
**Date of Admission:** 04/01/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/11/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock and acute respiratory failure.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- I21.3: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) of unspecified site  
- R57.0: Cardiogenic shock  
- J96.00: Acute respiratory failure, unspecified whether with hypoxia or hypercapnia  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. Electrocardiogram showed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and emergent coronary angiography revealed 100% occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement was performed. During the procedure, the patient developed cardiogenic shock, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and initiation of vasopressor support. She also developed acute respiratory failure and was intubated for ventilatory support in the intensive care unit.  

Management included dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and high-intensity statins. Critical care focused on hemodynamic stabilization and gradual weaning off vasopressors and ventilatory support. By day 9, the patient was extubated, IABP was removed, and she showed significant clinical improvement.  

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Aspirin, 81 mg daily.  
- Clopidogrel, 75 mg daily.  
- Atorvastatin, 80 mg nightly.  
- Carvedilol, 12.5 mg twice daily.  
- Lisinopril, 10 mg daily.  
- Nitroglycerin, 0.4 mg sublingually as needed for chest pain.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with her cardiologist within one week. An echocardiogram is recommended to reassess left ventricular function. She is also referred to cardiac rehabilitation to improve her functional capacity and long-term outcomes. Immediate medical attention should be sought if she experiences recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness.  

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on lifestyle modifications, including a heart-healthy diet, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity as tolerated. Education on medication adherence and recognizing warning signs of recurrent myocardial infarction was provided. Family members were encouraged to participate in her recovery process and were given resources for emotional support.
