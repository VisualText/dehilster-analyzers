Certainly! Here's an example of a detailed and complex medical discharge summary with corresponding ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Jane Doe 
**Birthdate:** 01/03/1963
**Date of Admission:** 03/23/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 03/30/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Patient fatigued
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- J44.1: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation  
- J18.9: Pneumonia, unspecified organism  
- E11.65: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia  
- I10: Essential (primary) hypertension  
- E66.01: Obesity due to excess calories  The patient was admitted for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by a concurrent community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia.

**Hospital Course:**  
Ms. Doe is a 62-year-old female with a significant history of COPD, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity (BMI: 32.5 kg/m²), who presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea, productive cough with yellow sputum, fever (101.3°F), and fatigue for four days. Chest X-ray revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Initial lab work showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 16,500/µL) and hyperglycemia (blood glucose: 312 mg/dL). 

The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) and nebulized bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium). Blood glucose levels were managed with subcutaneous insulin therapy. During hospitalization, spirometry confirmed a moderate obstructive ventilatory defect. Oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula was required to maintain an SpO2 of 92%. 

On day 3, the patient developed worsening respiratory distress, requiring transfer to the ICU for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). After stabilization, she was gradually weaned off NIPPV and transitioned back to low-flow oxygen. Glycemic control improved with basal-bolus insulin regimen. Comprehensive discharge education was provided on COPD management, inhaler technique, and diabetes self-care. 

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Azithromycin 500 mg PO once daily for 4 days  
- Albuterol sulfate inhaler, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed  
- Budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) inhaler, 2 puffs twice daily  
- Insulin glargine (Lantus), 10 units subcutaneously at bedtime  
- Insulin lispro (Humalog), sliding scale with meals  
- Acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 6 hours as needed for fever  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient was discharged in stable condition on oral antibiotics, bronchodilator therapy, and basal-bolus insulin. Follow-up was arranged with her primary care provider and pulmonologist in one week.
