Here’s another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Emma Collins  
**Birthdate:** 12/03/1950 
**Date of Admission:** 04/04/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/15/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Acute liver failure due to acetaminophen toxicity, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- K72.0: Acute and subacute hepatic failure  
- T39.1X1A: Poisoning by acetaminophen, accidental (initial encounter)  
- R41.82: Altered mental status, unspecified (due to hepatic encephalopathy)  
- D68.9: Coagulopathy, unspecified  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with jaundice, confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Blood tests showed elevated liver enzymes, ammonia levels, and a prolonged INR consistent with acute liver failure. The patient admitted to inadvertently taking excessive doses of acetaminophen over several days. Hepatic encephalopathy was evident, and coagulopathy further complicated the clinical picture. 

Initial management included IV N-acetylcysteine therapy to counteract acetaminophen toxicity, fluid resuscitation, and correction of coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. Lactulose was administered to reduce ammonia levels and manage encephalopathy symptoms. Gastroenterology and toxicology were consulted, and the patient was monitored closely in the intensive care unit. Over the hospital stay, liver function gradually improved, and neurological symptoms resolved. By discharge, the patient was stable and tolerating oral medications.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Lactulose, 30 mL orally twice daily.  
- Vitamin K, 10 mg orally daily for 5 days.  
- Multivitamins to support recovery.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a hepatologist within one week to reassess liver function and monitor for potential chronic liver disease. Bloodwork, including liver enzymes, INR, and ammonia levels, should be repeated before follow-up visits. Immediate medical attention should be sought if symptoms such as confusion, jaundice, or bleeding occur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on acetaminophen safety and advised to avoid alcohol or medications that may further compromise liver function. Lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet and hydration, were recommended. Educational materials about acute liver failure recovery were provided to the patient and family.
