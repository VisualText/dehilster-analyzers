Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Olivia Barnes  
**Birthdate:** 09/07/1959  
**Date of Admission:** 03/26/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/03/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Infective endocarditis complicated by septic emboli and acute kidney injury.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- I33.0: Acute and subacute infective endocarditis  
- B37.6: Candidal endocarditis (causative organism identified as Candida species)  
- N17.9: Acute kidney failure, unspecified  
- I74.8: Embolism and thrombosis of other specified arteries  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with fever, fatigue, a new heart murmur, and skin findings suggestive of Janeway lesions. Blood cultures grew *Candida albicans*, and echocardiography confirmed vegetation on the mitral valve consistent with infective endocarditis. The patient subsequently developed acute kidney injury and septic emboli causing localized ischemia in the left lower extremity.  

Management included antifungal therapy with intravenous amphotericin B, fluid resuscitation for kidney injury, and anticoagulation for the prevention of further emboli. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to evaluate for valve replacement, but surgical intervention was deferred as the patient stabilized under medical management. By discharge, renal function was improving, and repeat blood cultures were negative.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Oral fluconazole, 400 mg once daily for 6 weeks.  
- Apixaban, 5 mg twice daily.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for fever or pain.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with an infectious disease specialist and nephrologist in one week. A cardiology appointment is also recommended to monitor the mitral valve. Bloodwork, including renal function tests and follow-up blood cultures, should be completed before the follow-up visit. Return to the hospital immediately if symptoms such as fever, worsening swelling, or chest pain occur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on recognizing signs of embolic events or recurrent infection. Education on proper hydration and kidney function preservation was provided, along with lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of systemic infections.
