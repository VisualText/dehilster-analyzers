Absolutely! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** David White  
**Birthdate:** 09/24/1974 
**Date of Admission:** 04/03/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/13/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Spinal epidural abscess complicated by paraplegia and urinary tract infection.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- G06.2: Extradural and subdural abscess, unspecified  
- G82.20: Paraplegia, unspecified  
- N39.0: Urinary tract infection, site not specified  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with severe back pain, fever, and progressive lower extremity weakness. MRI of the spine revealed a spinal epidural abscess compressing the thoracic spinal cord. Blood and urine cultures grew *Staphylococcus aureus*, confirming the infectious etiology. The patient developed complete paraplegia below the T7 level shortly after admission.

Emergency neurosurgery was performed, including laminectomy and drainage of the abscess, to relieve spinal cord compression. Antibiotic therapy with IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated to target the pathogen. The patient also required Foley catheter placement for urinary retention. Over the hospital stay, paraplegia persisted, but infection markers improved significantly, and blood and urine cultures cleared.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Vancomycin, 1 g IV every 12 hours to complete a 6-week course.  
- Ceftriaxone, 2 g IV once daily for 6 weeks.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with infectious disease and neurosurgery specialists within one week to monitor response to therapy and assess for signs of recurrent infection. A referral to a spinal rehabilitation program was provided to optimize mobility and quality of life. Bloodwork, including complete blood count and inflammatory markers, should be completed prior to the follow-up. 

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was educated on signs of infection recurrence, including fever or worsening back pain. Care instructions for the Foley catheter were provided to minimize the risk of urinary tract infections. Resources for paraplegia support groups and psychological counseling were also offered to address the emotional impact of the condition.
