Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Benjamin Carter  
**Birthdate:** 08/30/1966
**Date of Admission:** 03/24/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/01/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation and dyslipidemia.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- I63.9: Cerebral infarction, unspecified (Ischemic Stroke)  
- I48.91: Unspecified atrial fibrillation  
- E78.5: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient was admitted following the sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. CT and MRI confirmed an ischemic stroke affecting the left middle cerebral artery territory. Echocardiography and electrocardiogram identified atrial fibrillation as a probable source of embolism. Elevated lipid levels were noted on laboratory investigations, indicating dyslipidemia as an underlying risk factor.  

Management included thrombolytic therapy with alteplase administered within the therapeutic window and anticoagulation with apixaban to address atrial fibrillation. The patient was also initiated on statin therapy to manage dyslipidemia. Physical therapy was commenced during hospitalization to aid in recovery of motor function. By discharge, the patient had regained partial motor function in the right arm and showed improved speech clarity.  

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Apixaban, 5 mg twice daily.  
- Atorvastatin, 80 mg nightly.  
- Aspirin, 81 mg daily.  
- Amlodipine, 5 mg once daily for blood pressure control.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a neurologist and cardiologist within one week. A rehabilitation plan with physical and occupational therapy is recommended. Blood lipid levels and coagulation markers should be monitored regularly. Immediate medical attention should be sought if recurrent stroke symptoms such as sudden weakness or confusion occur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient received education on recognizing signs of stroke recurrence and was counseled on lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, a low-fat diet, and regular physical activity. Stroke prevention resources were provided to the patient and family members.
