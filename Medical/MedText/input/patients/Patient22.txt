Certainly! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Sophia Martinez  
**Birthdate:** 02/28/1969 
**Date of Admission:** 03/31/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/09/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Acute pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- I26.99: Other pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale  
- I82.409: Acute embolism and thrombosis of unspecified deep veins of lower extremity  
- J44.9: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with acute onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli, and venous duplex imaging revealed DVT in the left lower extremity. The patient also reported worsening dyspnea associated with her underlying COPD. Initial management included anticoagulation therapy with IV heparin followed by transition to oral warfarin and oxygen supplementation for hypoxia.

Pulmonology was consulted for COPD management, and the patient was treated with bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics (for presumed superimposed infection). Physical therapy was initiated for early ambulation and prevention of venous stasis. Over the hospital stay, the patientâ€™s respiratory status improved, and repeat imaging showed stabilization of the pulmonary embolism.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Warfarin, 5 mg daily (INR monitoring required).  
- Albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed.  
- Prednisone, 20 mg daily for 5 days, followed by taper.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a pulmonologist within one week for COPD management and with a hematologist to monitor anticoagulation and assess for potential hypercoagulable states. INR levels should be monitored twice weekly until stable. Immediate medical attention should be sought if symptoms such as severe dyspnea, chest pain, or leg swelling occur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient received counseling on adherence to anticoagulation therapy and precautions to avoid injury or bleeding. Smoking cessation resources and COPD education were provided to improve long-term respiratory health. Instructions on recognizing signs of DVT or embolism recurrence were shared with the patient and caregivers.
