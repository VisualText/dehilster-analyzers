---

**Patient Name:** Sarah Johnson  
**Birthdate:** 11/02/1949 
**Date of Admission:** 03/23/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 03/31/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Multisystem complications related to lupus nephritis, hypertension, and acute on chronic anemia.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- M32.14: Systemic lupus erythematosus with organ or system involvement (lupus nephritis)  
- I10: Essential (primary) hypertension  
- D63.1: Anemia in chronic kidney disease  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with generalized fatigue, edema, and worsening hypertension. Laboratory findings were notable for proteinuria, elevated creatinine, and low hemoglobin levels. A renal biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis. Acute on chronic anemia was diagnosed, likely secondary to chronic kidney disease associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. 

The patient was started on high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for three days, followed by oral prednisone taper and mycophenolate mofetil to manage the lupus nephritis. Antihypertensive therapy was adjusted with the addition of a calcium channel blocker to achieve better blood pressure control. For anemia, the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and was started on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Over the hospital stay, her symptoms improved, with reduced edema and stable hemoglobin levels.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Prednisone, 20 mg once daily, with a gradual taper over six weeks.  
- Mycophenolate mofetil, 500 mg twice daily.  
- Amlodipine, 5 mg once daily.  
- Erythropoietin injections, as instructed by a nephrologist.  
- Iron supplement, 325 mg once daily.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with her nephrologist and rheumatologist in one week. Blood pressure and kidney function should be closely monitored. She was instructed to contact her healthcare provider immediately if she experiences symptoms such as severe fatigue, chest pain, or shortness of breath.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient received education on recognizing signs of lupus flares and managing hypertension. Dietary recommendations included low sodium and adequate fluid intake to support kidney function and manage hypertension.
