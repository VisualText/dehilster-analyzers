Certainly! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Daniel Rodriguez  
**Birthdate:** 07/14/1975 
**Date of Admission:** 03/25/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/02/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Complicated acute pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation and secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- K85.3: Acute pancreatitis with pseudocyst  
- J80: Acute respiratory distress syndrome  
- E86.0: Dehydration  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Laboratory tests showed elevated lipase levels, and a CT abdomen confirmed acute pancreatitis with a developing pseudocyst. During hospitalization, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation and close monitoring.

Management included bowel rest with nasogastric tube placement, aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent secondary infection. Pulmonology was consulted for ARDS, and the patient was managed with lung-protective ventilation strategies. Over the hospital stay, respiratory function improved, and the patient was weaned off mechanical ventilation. The pseudocyst was monitored with serial imaging, showing no signs of rupture or infection.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Pantoprazole, 40 mg daily for gastrointestinal protection.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain.  
- Multivitamins to address nutritional deficits.  
- Oral rehydration salts to maintain hydration.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a gastroenterologist within one week to monitor the pseudocyst and assess the need for drainage if symptoms persist. A pulmonary follow-up is recommended to evaluate respiratory recovery. The patient should seek immediate care if experiencing severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, or signs of infection, such as fever or chills.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient received education on a low-fat diet and avoiding alcohol to reduce the risk of pancreatitis recurrence. Hydration and nutritional counseling were provided to aid in recovery.
