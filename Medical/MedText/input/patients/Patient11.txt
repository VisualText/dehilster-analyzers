Certainly! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** William Henderson
**Birthdate:** 04/21/1963
**Date of Admission:** 03/22/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 03/30/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by pneumonia and heart failure.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- J44.1: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation  
- J18.9: Pneumonia, unspecified organism  
- I50.9: Heart failure, unspecified  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with increased shortness of breath, productive cough, and fever. Chest X-ray revealed pneumonia affecting the right lower lobe, while physical examination indicated bilateral lower extremity edema and elevated jugular venous pressure, consistent with heart failure exacerbation. Arterial blood gas showed hypoxemia, and sputum cultures confirmed Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

Management included supplemental oxygen, nebulized bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics (IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin). The patient was also initiated on diuretics and optimized on heart failure medications, including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. The patientâ€™s respiratory symptoms and edema improved significantly over the hospital stay. By discharge, oxygen saturation was stable, and the patient was ambulating comfortably.  

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Albuterol sulfate inhaler, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed.  
- Prednisone, 40 mg daily for 5 days.  
- Furosemide, 40 mg daily.  
- Lisinopril, 10 mg daily.  
- Azithromycin, 250 mg once daily for 4 days.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with their pulmonologist and cardiologist within one week. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended to improve respiratory function and endurance. Return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen, such as severe shortness of breath or chest pain.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The importance of smoking cessation was discussed extensively, and nicotine replacement therapy options were provided. The patient was also counseled on dietary changes to limit fluid and sodium intake as part of heart failure management.
