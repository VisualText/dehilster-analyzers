Of course! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Kevin Foster  
**Birthdate:** 03/22/1957
**Date of Admission:** 03/31/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/10/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Severe acute pancreatitis with necrosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and secondary acute kidney injury.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- K85.8: Other acute pancreatitis (with necrosis)  
- R65.10: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without acute organ dysfunction  
- N17.9: Acute kidney failure, unspecified  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory tests showed significantly elevated lipase and amylase levels, and a CT abdomen revealed necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient met criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), with tachycardia and leukocytosis, and subsequently developed acute kidney injury as evidenced by elevated creatinine and decreased urine output.

Management included aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and bowel rest with nasogastric decompression. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) due to concern for infected pancreatic necrosis, though cultures remained negative. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated to manage acute kidney injury. A multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology and nephrology, managed the patient. Over the hospital stay, the patientâ€™s inflammatory markers improved, renal function partially recovered, and abdominal symptoms stabilized.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Pantoprazole, 40 mg twice daily.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain.  
- Oral hydration salts to maintain adequate fluid status.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a gastroenterologist within one week for further evaluation of pancreatic necrosis and potential need for drainage. A nephrology follow-up is recommended to monitor kidney function and recovery. Serial imaging and renal function tests should be performed before follow-up visits. Return to the emergency department if symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, or decreased urine output recur.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on the importance of adhering to a low-fat diet and avoiding alcohol to minimize the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. Education on maintaining hydration and recognizing early signs of complications, such as infection or worsening renal function, was provided.
