You're welcome! Here’s another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Hannah Lewis  
**Birthdate:** 07/09/1946 
**Date of Admission:** 04/02/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/12/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Cerebral abscess complicated by seizures and bacterial meningitis.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- G06.0: Intracranial and intraspinal abscess and granuloma  
- G40.909: Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus  
- G00.9: Bacterial meningitis, unspecified  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with headache, fever, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits, including left-sided weakness. MRI revealed a cerebral abscess in the right frontal lobe. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and started on IV antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) and dexamethasone to reduce inflammation. During hospitalization, she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, prompting initiation of anticonvulsant therapy. Lumbar puncture confirmed concurrent bacterial meningitis. Neurosurgery was consulted, and stereotactic aspiration of the abscess was performed successfully.  

The patient’s neurological status and inflammatory markers improved over the hospital stay, and repeat imaging showed significant reduction in abscess size. Seizures were well controlled, and the patient was transitioned to oral anticonvulsant therapy by discharge.  

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levetiracetam, 500 mg twice daily.  
- Ceftriaxone, 2 g IV once daily to complete a 6-week course.  
- Dexamethasone, 4 mg daily tapered over 2 weeks.  
- Acetaminophen, 500 mg as needed for pain or fever.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a neurologist and infectious disease specialist in one week. Repeat MRI and laboratory work, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, are recommended prior to follow-up appointments. Immediate medical attention should be sought if she experiences recurrent seizures, worsening headache, or fever.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient was counseled on medication adherence and seizure precautions, including avoiding activities with high risk of injury during seizures. She was provided with educational resources about brain abscess recovery and meningitis prevention strategies. Family members were involved in care planning and received guidance on emergency response in case of seizure recurrence.
