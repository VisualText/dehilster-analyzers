Certainly! Here's another detailed medical discharge summary with multiple ICD-10 codes:

---

**Patient Name:** Thomas Williams  
**Birthdate:** 06/18/1968
**Date of Admission:** 03/28/2025  
**Date of Discharge:** 04/06/2025  
**Reason for Admission:** Acute gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease, chronic kidney disease, and secondary anemia.  
**ICD-10 Codes:**  
- K25.4: Chronic or unspecified gastric ulcer with hemorrhage  
- D50.0: Iron deficiency anemia secondary to blood loss (chronic)  
- N18.3: Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient presented with hematemesis, melena, fatigue, and dizziness. Laboratory findings revealed profound anemia and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels, indicative of underlying chronic kidney disease. Endoscopy confirmed a bleeding gastric ulcer with active hemorrhage. He was stabilized with IV fluids, blood transfusions, and proton pump inhibitor therapy (IV pantoprazole). The bleeding was successfully managed with endoscopic intervention, including cauterization and application of hemostatic clips. 

Nephrology was consulted for chronic kidney disease, and adjustments to his renal protective medication regimen were made. Iron deficiency anemia was addressed with intravenous iron supplementation. Over the hospital stay, the patientâ€™s hemoglobin levels improved, and gastrointestinal bleeding resolved. By discharge, he was hemodynamically stable and tolerating a soft diet without nausea or vomiting.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Pantoprazole, 40 mg twice daily.  
- Ferrous sulfate, 325 mg once daily.  
- Amlodipine, 5 mg once daily for blood pressure control.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a gastroenterologist in one week for repeat endoscopy and with a nephrologist to monitor kidney function and adjust medications as needed. Bloodwork, including hemoglobin levels and renal function tests, should be repeated before follow-up visits. Any recurrence of hematemesis, melena, or severe fatigue should prompt immediate medical attention.

**Additional Instructions:**  
The patient received dietary counseling, emphasizing a low-sodium, renal-friendly diet and avoidance of NSAIDs to reduce gastrointestinal bleeding risk. He was provided with educational materials regarding ulcer prevention and chronic kidney disease management.
