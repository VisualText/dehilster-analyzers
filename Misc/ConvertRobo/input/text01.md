# Functions and Actions

## Functions
NLP++ supports function calls,  which have a similar form to other programming languages (such as C/C++):

**functionName(arg1, .... argN)**

where functionName is constrained to be alphabetic and where each argument to the function may be an NLP++ expression. 

Only call-by-value arguments are supported at present. That means that when a variable is used as an argument,  its value is not changed by a change to the local variable that it becomes associated with in the function. 

Functions have no template or declaration -- only a definition. Even so,  you may use a function in one pass and define it in a subsequent pass (forward reference). The parameters to functions take arbitrary data types that may vary dynamically. Return statements similarly return arbitrary data types. The same function could return a numeric value in one call and a string in another. We discourage the abuse of this extreme flexibility,  however! The new **L** variable reference has been introduced to support formal function parameters as well as local variables within a function body. Recursive functions are also possible. The example below illustrates the definition and use of user-defined functions in NLP++. 

```
@DECL

```
xuf(**L**(var))

{

output.txt<< **L**(var)<< \n;

**L**(local) = 3;# create a local variable.

output.txt<< **L**(local)<< \n;

**return **1+2;

}



facto(**L**(num))# recursive factorial function.

{

**if **(**L**(num)<= 0)

**return **1;

**return ****L**(num) * facto(**L**(num) - 1);

}

```
@@DECL



@CODE

```
**G**(x)[2] = 3;

output.txt<< **G**(x)<< \n;

xuf(**G**(x));

output.txt<< 4! = << facto(4)<< \n;

```
@@CODE

```


The code above prints out

0 0 3

0 0 3

3

4!  = 24


## Actions
Actions,  e. g. ,  **single**,  are specialized functions that don't take generalized NLP++ expressions as arguments. Though some actions have been upgraded and now take NLP++ arguments (e. g.  **group**),  some actions have not been upgraded and the argument must be a literal value. 

A unique feature of actions in the PRE Region is that they have a mandatory range. The syntax is as follows:

**num,num preactionname(args....)**

The action applies to each rule element in the<num,  num> range individually. 

See[Actions](Actions.md) as a starting point for per-page descriptions for actions. 


## Case Sensitivity
NLP++ function and action names are case-sensitive. 


## <a name=define></a>Defining New Functions
In VisualText 1. 2 and later,  user-defined NLP++ functions are fully supported,  including parameter lists,  return statements,  recursive calls,  and compilation of these. Functions are specified in the @DECL region,  which must appear first within a pass file,  if present. 

New NLP++ functions can also be defined with C++ code, 0within an application's **user** project.  User-defined function calls must be preceded by the '*user*' scope qualifier,  e. g. ,  *user::myfunction*.  (Interpreted NLP++ will find the correct function and issue a warning,  but user functions without the scope qualifier will be compiled incorrectly. )
