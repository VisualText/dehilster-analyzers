**Notes**: The \$uppercase, \$lowercase, \$cap, and \$unknown differ from the analogous PRE Actions in that they all traverse down to the leafiest node they can find, in order to perform their check. The corresponding PRE Actions only chain down if the [s] flag is present in the associated phrase element(s). Also, the \$ variables are not stopped by a [base] attribute in a node.
