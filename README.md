# Analyzers by David de Hilster

The purpose of this repositor is to store analyzers written by David de Hilster, one of the architects of NLP++ and VisualText (now the [NLP++ language extension](http://vscode.visualtext.org) for Vscode).

## KB to KBB

These are analyzers for converting KB files to KBB files. The idea is to make as many of the KB files in human readable form. The idea is to eventually replace all kb files.
